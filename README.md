# Bob-Ross-Webpage
A recreation / rehashing of my CS284 final project.

This project utilizes the [elements-by-episode.csv](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/blob/master/bob-ross/elements-by-episode.csv) by [FiveThirtyEight](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight) broken into several tables and put into a MariaDB.

The files in the data folder represent the different tables I broke the original .csv file into.
